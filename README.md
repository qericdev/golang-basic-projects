Golang Basic Projects
This repository, golang-basic-projects, is a collection of mini-projects developed in Go language. Each project in this repository focuses on a different fundamental concept in programming.

Here are the projects currently available in this repository:

1. Factorial Function
The factorialfunction project calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

2. Fibonacci Sequence
The fibonaccisequence project generates the Fibonacci series up to a specified term. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where the next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

3. Hello World
The helloworld project is the most basic program possible in Go. It's used as a starting point for any new Go programmer and simply prints out the message "Hello, World!".

4. String Reversal
The stringreversal project is used to reverse the input string. It's a common exercise to understand string manipulation in any language.

5. Sum and Average
The sumandaverage project takes multiple numbers as input and calculates their sum and average.
